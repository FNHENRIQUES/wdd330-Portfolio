The backslash is used to escape special characters in strings such as:

Single quote marks \'

Double quote marks \"

End of line \n

Carriage return \r

Tab \t

If you want to actually write a backslash, you need to escape it with another backslash:

"This is a backslash \\"
<< "This is a backslash \"
