CSS3 Transforms, transitions and animation.</p>
<p>Transforms</p>
<pre> The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.
To use transform in CSS you must call transform: and the function to transform as:
.ad-ad2 h1:hover span {
    color: #484848;
    transform: rotate(10deg) translateX(40px) scale(1.5);
}

Translation
	Move things in any direction on page.
Scaling
The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio. You can also transform inline text.
Rotation 
The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. As with scale , by default the point of origin is the element’s center. Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise. In addition to degrees, values can be provided in grads, radians, or turns, but we’ll just be sticking with degrees.
Skew
The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis
You need use some filters to use transform in Older version browsers as these functions with -webkit- and -ms- or other tools
</pre>
<p>Transition</p><pre>
With transition you can make animations Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:

Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.

Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.

Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: transition-property , transition-duration , transition-timing-function , and transition-delay . We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.
We can use multiple transition only and together as:
transition-property: transform, color; 
transition-duration: 0.2s;  
transition-timing-function: ease-out;
transition-delay: 50ms;
</pre>	
<p>Animation</p><pre> 
	Keyframes 
@-webkit-keyframes myAnimation { 
    /* put animation keyframes here */
}
@keyframes myAnimation { 
    /* put animation keyframes here */
}

@keyframes moveRight { 
    from {
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    }
    to {
    transform: translateX(50%);
    }
}
@keyframes appearDisappear { 
    0%, 100% {
    opacity: 0;
    }
    20%, 80% {
    opacity: 1;
    }
}
@keyframes bgMove {
    100% {
    background-position: 120% 0;
    }
}
•	@keyframes
•	animation-name
•	animation-duration
•	animation-delay
•	animation-iteration-count
•	animation-direction
•	animation-timing-function
•	animation-fill-mode
•	animation
Key frames rule the animation will gradually change during specific time. We can do all in CSS without code and flash.

<p>We learned also about CANVAS we can define in CANVAS the positioning of elementes draw, drag, drop and storage elements as display.</p>
